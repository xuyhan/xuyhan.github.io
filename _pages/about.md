I am a 22 year old Welsh Computer Scientist, having recently graduated from the University of Cambridge with a bachelor's and master's in Computer Science. I'm interested in developing advanced technologies that challenge consensus. I currently work at a prop trading firm.
* I am interested in *pushing the frontiers of AI* by making AI more reliable and robust in applications across society.
* I enjoy weightlifting and watching anime! I also like playing videogames, as well as making them.
